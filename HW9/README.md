Partners with Sam M, Desi Pilla, and Catherine Harty

For this project I worked mostly with Catherine and colaborated with Desi and Sam over groupme. Work was done separately and if
anyone ran into conflicts, we communicated for help.

1-Day extension is being used for this submission. Final result of homework will be available tomorrow.
