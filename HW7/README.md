Partners with Catherine Harty, Desi Pilla, and Samuel M

For the first part of the lab, we all worked separately. Catherine and I worked together and collaborated on different parts
of the lab. At the completion of the first half, we compared our results and found them in agreement.

For the second part of the lab I worked entirely with Catherine. Any colaboration with the other group members was done over groupme when difficulties arised, however we all completed this homework using our own methods.
