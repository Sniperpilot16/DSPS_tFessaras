We all met for a total of roughly 10 hours. Together, we walked through each step of the homework and bounced ideas off
of each other while completing the same problems. There was a mixture of reading the paper while others developed ideas on how to perform K-S test. There was no division of labour, rather we worked as a team to cumulatively solve the problems.

Met again briefly and collaborated for final part of homework, had difficulty with producing feasible results with K-S tests but some results were generated.
