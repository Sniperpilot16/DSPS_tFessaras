CLARITY:  In all, this graph is very hard to read. I understand that this is a pie chart for the classifications of mushrooms. 
          However, the only reason I know this is because of the caption. There is no title and quite  abit of jargon relating to 
          mushroom classification. 

AESTHETIC: I see how there are different laters to it, but what exactly does the color relate to? Whether its edible or not? 
            Additionally, pie charts especially like this one are hard to read, not impossible, but definately does not convey and 
            easy message to the audience. However, in black and white this would still convey a relatively similar message.

HONESTY: I do not see this plot deforming the data at all. Good job with that. 

SUGGESTIONS:
        1. I would change this from being a pie chart to some other medium entirely. Pie charts do not convey messages the 
          clearest. 
        2. Additionally I would add a title to this chart. The caption is good and informative for the most part, but a titel would
          be the icing on the cake. 
        3. Your caption should include what the colors represent. If you dont put it in your caption then represent it in a 
          legend to the side of your graph.
